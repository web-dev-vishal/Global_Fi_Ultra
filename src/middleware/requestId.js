/**
 * Global-Fi Ultra - Request ID Middleware
 * 
 * Injects a unique UUID v4 request identifier into every incoming HTTP request
 * for distributed tracing and log correlation.
 * 
 * How It Works:
 * 1. Checks for an existing `X-Request-Id` header (set by upstream proxies,
 *    load balancers, or API gateways like Nginx or Render).
 * 2. If found, reuses it to maintain trace continuity across services.
 * 3. If not found, generates a new UUID v4 identifier.
 * 4. Attaches the ID to `req.requestId` for use by downstream middleware
 *    and controllers (logging, error responses, etc.).
 * 5. Sets the `X-Request-Id` response header so the client can correlate
 *    their request with server-side logs.
 * 
 * Usage in Other Middleware:
 * - `requestLogger.js` logs `req.requestId` on every request
 * - `errorHandler.js` includes `requestId` in all error responses
 * - `rateLimiter.js` logs `req.requestId` when limits are exceeded
 * 
 * @module middleware/requestId
